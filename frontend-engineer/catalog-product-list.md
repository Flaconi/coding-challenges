Create a simple project to provide a responsive frontend to show a multi-column list of products for an e-commerce website as you can see on https://www.flaconi.de/parfum/.

The product entities have the following structure and will be provided in an array of products:
```javascript
{
        id: <String>,
        name: <String>,
        slug: <String>,
        brand: <String>,
        type: <String>,
        image: <String>,
        price: <Integer>,
        size: <String>,
        rating: <Integer>
}
```

id is the product SKU, image contains a full URL, the price is in cents and the rating with a scale of 0 to 100.

## Required functionality:
