If something is not clear or you need help - just ask :smile:. Nobody knows everything!

1. Read the task
2. Create a project
3. Please implement the project according to your own best standards, possibly
   - Tests, tdd
   - Code guidelines
   - Structure / architecture
   - Refactoring
   - Conventions
4. For the layout bootstrap or plain design is enough.
5. Make sure to commit frequently and feel free to stop working on it after 1-2 hours
6. Provide an overview which points you would improve if you had more time to work on the project

## Scenario - Weathermap api client

Your app should be a client for the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/API#weather) JSON api

Features that should work:

- Display the weather at random geographic coordinates
- A form with city and country that fetches and displays the weather in this city
  - optional: cache the fetched weather data
- Gracefully handle the case where the city could not be found (display the information to the user)

Have fun!
