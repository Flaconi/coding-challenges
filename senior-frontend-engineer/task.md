# Senior Frontend Engineer

## Description
Create simple drag and drop layout builder.It should give the ability to build layouts from a set of customisable React components.
The result of it should be configuration, which can be used by page to render.

## Stack
Our frontend stack consists of React, ES6, Styled Components and GraphQL.

You are required to use that same stack in this assignment.
Additional libraries are permitted. 

To speed things up, you can use CRA to bootstrap your app.

## Required functionality:
* It should provide at least 1 possible layout to render
* It should be possible to see how it looks like on mobile and tablet
* It should be possible to render with it as least 3 components, like text, button, image
* It should be possible to get the configuration of created page

## Hints
* You need to think about output data structure on your own.
* Threat this project as if you would continue working on this after your assignment: maintainability, scalability, and readability are super important.
* Even though we allow third-party libraries, try to rely as little as possible on tools that write React-, Redux-, CSS-related code for you. 
* If you have any questions feel free to ask us! 

## Hope you enjoy it!
